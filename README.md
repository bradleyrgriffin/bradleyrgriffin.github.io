This is the code for a current iteration of my website; contains all of the source code
aside from my contact form function (Powered by SimpleForm, have to use SimpleForm because
github pages are static, and not dynamic (also, they don't support PHP)).

If you want to clone this repo, or copy the source code, feel free to:
This website iteration was made using:

1. M. Reza's template design (my design skills are not nearly as good). "https://bodo.microweber.com/"
2. Simple Form code snippets.
3. Personally developed code and design.
